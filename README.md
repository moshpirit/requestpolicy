# RequestPolicy (continued)

## About RequestPolicy

RequestPolicy is a Firefox extension that gives you control over cross-site requests. It does this through user-defined whitelists and blacklists. Users can also subscribe to policies (whitelists and blacklists) maintained by others.

For more information about RequestPolicy and cross-site requests, have a look at [our website](https://requestpolicycontinued.github.io/)

## This project

The RequestPolicy "Continued" project is a fork of [RequestPolicy](https://github.com/RequestPolicy/requestpolicy), which had been developed by [Justin Samuel](https://github.com/jsamuel) until 2012. Currently we aim at releasing our first stable version – 1.0 – but there is still much to do. If you want to be informed about this milestone, you could subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/446). If you're interested, [here](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/milestones/1.0)  you can find a list of all open issues for version 1.0.


## Getting the Source Code

If you'd like to download the RequestPolicy source code from our version control system, you can do so with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy.git
```

## Building the XPI Firefox addon

To create an [XPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPI) file, run `make` from the repository's root directory.  It will be created at `dist/requestpolicy.xpi` and can be used for easy installation of RP into your web browser (Firefox).

### Discussion
If you have any questions or general thoughts about the project, please post them in our [general discussion](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues/484)


### Testing, reporting bugs & requesting new features

Always use the [latest release](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/releases/), or [build the XPI from the most recent source revision](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy#getting-the-source-code)

If you'd like a bug to be fixed or a feature added, [find if it has already been reported](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues). Open a new issue if needed, and add information about the bug/request such as:

 * Steps to reproduce the bug (user actions)
 * What should happen.
 * What happens instead.

Response time from the maintainers should be around a few days.

**Please bear in mind that each user might have a different browser setup. Sometimes it's necessary to further investigate the problem:**

Some bugs are caused by other Firefox addons interfering with RequestPolicy. To make sure a bug is caused by RequestPolicy itself:

 * Disable all other addons from Firefox's addon manager
 * Try to reproduce the bug

If the bug does _not_ happen with only RPC enabled, the bug is related to another addon:

 * Re-enable one addon, test again.
 * Repeat until the problem occurs again
 * [Report us](https://github.com/RequestPolicyContinued/requestpolicy/issues) the incompatible addon (with a link to the addon download page)

To test if the bug is related to your specific configuration, you can [create a new, blank Firefox profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) and try to reproduce the bug.

You can ask the maintainers to close already fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are happening, or remove duplicate bug reports.
